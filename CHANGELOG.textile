h1. CHANGELOG

h2. v1.4

* Removed possibility of duplicate SEO entries, call set_metadata('keywords' twice and it will use the 2nd.
* Re-did inject logic, now its just for shoving a hunk of HTML into a partial.
* Fixed theme_exists(), it wasn't using slug name so falsly returned true.

h2. v1.3

You can now use any extension for your files, not just whatever EXT is set to.
Updated Template library to add support for getting theme layout lists and checking they exist.
Added more options to the default config file.
Now supports a config file that allows a default theme to be set and "Theme locations" to be used. That means you could have application/themes as one and third_party/themes as another.

h2. v1.2

Hooked up breadcrumbs to  variable.
Fixed undefined variable error by moving the reference assignment.

h2. v1.1

theme_view should support normal views as well
Partials now supported in views, not just layout views.

h2. v1.0

Initial commit.
